Payfort Start makes it easy (and free) to accept credit cards in the Middle East. You'll be live in 5 minutes.

== Description ==

Payfort is the only payment solution you need to start accepting online payments in the Middle East. That's right, no merchant accounts, no payment gateways and no visits to the bank. Get started online, and in under 5 minutes. (*Currently exclusively available to companies in the Middle East*)

= Using Wordpress + WooCommerce? =

Then you're going to love this!

This WooCommerce plugin makes integrating your store with Payfort a walk in the park! In the same time it would take you to make a cup of some great turkish coffee, you could be up and running with online payments!

Doesn't matter if you're in Bahrain, the UAE or Morocco .. it'll work fine either way!

= Requirements =

In order to start using Payfort, please head on over to [our website](https://start.payfort.com/) and register for an online account (it'll only take a minute; we'll wait..)

**Got the account?** Awesome .. now make sure to note the following details from your Dashboard:
- Test Secret Key
- Test Open Key
- Live Secret Key
- Live Open Key

We'll need these when we're setting up the plugin. Best part is .. you don't even have to be a developer to do the setup. It'll only take a minute.

1. Install the [Payfort plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/payfort) from your Wordpress Dashboard, under Plugins &rarr; Add New section.
2. Activate the plugin
3. Configure the options in the WooCommerce &rarr; Settings &rarr; Checkout screen. This includes the API keys you got from your [Payfort Dashboard](https://dashboard.start.payfort.com/)
